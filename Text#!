Difference b/w Frames and IFrames:

IFRAMES:
An inline frame (iframe) is a HTML element that loads another HTML page within the document. It essentially puts another webpage within the parent page.
They are commonly used for advertisements, embedded videos, web analytics and interactive content.

FRAMES:
HTML frames allow authors to present documents in multiple views. Views may be independent windows or subwindows. 
Multiple views offer designers a way to keep certain information visible, while other views are scrolled or replaced. 
For instance, to use three frames: 
one for a static banner, one for a navigation menu, and one for a main view that can be scrolled though or replaced by clicking on an item in the navigation frame.

Here's a simple frame document:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Frameset//EN">
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>A simple frameset document</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<FRAMESET cols="20%, 80%">
  <FRAMESET rows="100, 200">
      <FRAME src="contents_of_frame1.html">
      <FRAME src="contents_of_frame2.gif">
  </FRAMESET>
  <FRAME src="contents_of_frame3.html">
</FRAMESET>
</HTML>

that might create a frame layout something like this:
